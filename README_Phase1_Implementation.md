# Verdant Log - Phase 1 Core Systems Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides all the core backend systems required for Phase 1 of Project Verdant Log, as specified in the technical requirements document.

## Implemented Systems

### 1. Inventory & Item Database System
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/Inventory.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/Systems/ItemDatabase.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Persistent inventory management with stacking support
  - Global item database with ScriptableObject-based items
  - Event-driven updates for UI integration

### 2. Cultivation Condition System
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/CultivationManager.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Recipe-based cultivation with multiple condition types
  - Supports Time of Day, Item Used, and Adjacency conditions
  - Scalable architecture for adding new condition types

### 3. Player Progression System
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/PlayerStats.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Level and EXP management with configurable progression curve
  - Event system for level-up notifications
  - Data-driven progression settings

### 4. World & Unlock System
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/WorldManager.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Zone management with unlock conditions
  - Supports level-based and item-based unlocks
  - Automatic unlock checking on progression events

### 5. Encyclopedia (Log) System
- **Location**: `Assets/Scripts/Systems/EncyclopediaSystem.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Tracks discovered plants
  - Provides completion statistics
  - Integrates with cultivation success events

## Getting Started

### 1. Unity Setup
1. Create a new 2D project in Unity
2. Copy the entire `Assets` folder structure into your Unity project
3. Unity will compile the scripts automatically

### 2. Creating Test Assets
1. In Unity, go to menu: `Verdant Log > Create Test Assets > Create All Test Assets`
2. This will create sample items, plants, recipes, zones, and progression data

### 3. Setting Up a Test Scene
1. Create a new scene
2. Add a GameObject and attach the `GameManager` component
3. Import TextMeshPro essentials (Window → TextMeshPro → Import TMP Essential Resources)
4. Add UI Canvas with the following UI components:
   - `InventoryUI`
   - `PlayerStatsUI`
   - `EncyclopediaUI`
   - `TimeUI`
   - `NotificationUI`
5. Add `TestSystemIntegration` component for testing

### 4. Testing the Systems
Use the test keys (when TestSystemIntegration is active):
- **1-3**: Add different seeds and materials to inventory
- **4-6**: Test cultivation with different conditions
- **7**: Add 100 EXP to test leveling
- **8**: Check unlocked zones
- **T**: Toggle between day and night
- **I**: Open inventory
- **L**: Open encyclopedia

## Architecture Notes

### Event System
All systems communicate through a centralized event system (`GameEvents.cs`), ensuring loose coupling between systems.

### Data-Driven Design
All game data (items, plants, recipes, zones) are ScriptableObjects, allowing easy content creation and modification without code changes.

### Singleton Pattern
Core systems use a singleton pattern with lazy initialization for easy access throughout the codebase.

## Next Steps

1. **Create UI Prefabs**: Design and create the actual UI prefabs referenced in the UI scripts
2. **Scene Setup**: Create the game scenes (Hub, Forest, Cave, Swamp)
3. **Player Controller**: Implement player movement and interaction
4. **Cultivation Gameplay**: Create the actual planting mechanics and visual feedback
5. **Save System**: Implement persistent save/load functionality

## Important Notes

- All systems are designed to be scalable for future content
- The architecture supports the MVP scope while allowing for post-launch features
- Systems are intentionally decoupled to allow independent testing and development
- No combat, economy, or survival mechanics are included, as per the GDD specifications
